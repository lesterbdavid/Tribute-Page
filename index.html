                <q><i>In my view, leadership is the courage to take risks in defense of a position that is both legal and moral. The politician who tries to become a wise guy by becoming friends to everybody - corrupt or not - is not a leader.</i><br><br><i>Leadership is not about personality; it's about behaviour - an observable set of skills and abilities.</i></q><br><br>
